Added user profile management functionality allowing users to update their personal and contact information, with real-time reflection in the Supabase database.
### Vehicle Management System
Implemented a comprehensive vehicle management system for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting vehicle details.
Implemented row-level security (RLS) on the vehicles table, ensuring users can access and manipulate only their vehicle data.
### VIN Decoding
Added VIN decoding functionality that fetches vehicle specifications using the VIN from an external API via Axios requests.
Auto-fill vehicle details fields in the UI upon successful VIN decoding.
### Database Schema Enhancements
Updated the database schema to include detailed vehicle information such as make, model, year, and other specifications for comprehensive vehicle management.
## Axios Integration
### VIN API Integration
Utilized Axios for HTTP requests to a third-party VIN decoding API, enhancing the vehicle addition workflow by auto-filling details using the VIN.
Implemented error handling to manage and report errors during API requests, ensuring robustness.
### Dynamic Image Fetching
Implemented functionality to fetch vehicle images based on make, model, and year using a dynamic Axios request to an image search API, enriching vehicle profiles with visual data.
## UI/UX Improvements
### Responsive Design for Vehicle Pages
Enhanced the layout of vehicle addition and listing pages, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
### User Feedback Mechanisms
Integrated loading states and success/error messages across all interactions with external APIs and database transactions, providing clear feedback to the user.

Simplified the vehicle management interface, allowing for easier navigation, data entry, and modifications, including a one-click solution for all CRUD operations.
## Security Enhancements
### Secure Vehicle Data Handling
Ensured all vehicle data transmitted through the application is secured using HTTPS requests and maintained data integrity throughout operation lifecycle.
### Enhanced Authentication Security
Improved authentication flows with secure token management and session handling using Supabase, providing robust security against unauthorized access.
## Known Issues and Limitations
VIN decoding may not support all vehicle types and might return incomplete data for some VINs due to API limitations.
Image fetching is dependent on external API performance and availability, which might affect load times and data accuracy.
